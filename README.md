# Data-Visualisation-Report
### A composite visualisation and accompanying report I completed for a Master's assignment. 

Off the back of my investigation of enterprise growth in my first piece of coursework (see IJC437 repository) I decided to see if I could explain Doncaster's exceptional enterprise performance which my modelling could not. 

### Key Findings:
- Doncaster does not show exceptional growth in established businesses (at least 5 years old). 
- This is because its overall growth numbers are inflated by a high number of young businesses, most of which will not survive. 
- Therefore, it may be important to distinguish between established enterprises and young enterprises in studies of business demography.
