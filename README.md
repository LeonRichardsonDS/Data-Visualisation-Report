### The above is a composite visualisation and accompanying report I completed for a Master's assignment. 
To see the full report, datasets and R code look in the repository above. 

In my first report I investigated enterprise and employment growth in yorkshire and the humber (see IJC437 repository). However, the modelling I conducted could not explain Doncaster's exceptional enterprise performance. 

Given a second piece of coursework on the same topic, I leapt at the chance to see if I could explain through further investigation.

Here's what I found...

### Key Findings:
- Doncaster does not show exceptional growth in established businesses (at least 5 years old). 
- This is because its overall growth numbers are inflated by a high number of young businesses, most of which will not survive. 
- Therefore, it may be important to distinguish between established enterprises and young enterprises in studies of business demography.
